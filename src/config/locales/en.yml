        Before you can continue some important information.
        
        In auditorium 2.0 a lot has changed. Here is a list of a few changes:
        
        * Courses are now represented as groups. There are three group types available: Lecture, Study and Topic Groups.
        * In case a course was availabe in more than one semester, those courses will be summarized in one group.
        * The static structure between courses, chairs, institutes and faculties has been removed. Those relationships are now represented via tags. Tags are i.e., ’SS 13’, ’Fakultät Informatik’, etc.
        * Additionally to questions and announcements there is a new type called ’topic’ for discussions.
        * And more...

        **To continue you need to accept the <a target="_blank" href="/privacy" title="Open privacy policies in a new window.">privacy policies</a> of auditorium.**
