# Auditorium

The online platform auditorium is a project created in 2012 at the University of Technology in Dresden. The idea behind auditorium is to support students to ask their questions on specific lectures. Every user can ask and answer questions. The web application is hosted under http://auditorium.inf.tu-dresden.de for internal usage at the Faculty of Computer Science. 

If you want to install this app locally, just go to the src folder for further instructions.
