# Auditorium

Auditorium is a project created at the Dresden University of Technology in the summer semester 2012. The idea behind auditorium is to support students to ask their questions to specific lectures. Every user can ask and answer questions. The web application is hosted under http://auditorium.inf.tu-dresden.de for internal usage at the faculty of computer science. 

If you want to install this app locally, just go to the src folder for further instructions.
